Welcome! Today, I'm thrilled to give you a sneak peek into the future.

I'm a little girl who's traveled back from the future, and I'm eager to show you all the incredible things I've seen.

First off, you can transform your house into any place you want, in the blink of an eye. You could have breakfast in Paris, lunch in New York, all without leaving your home. Imagine the fun of exploring new places every day without packing a single bag!

Now, let's talk about a special potion that provided one of the most amazing experiences I've had: talking to animals. Yes, you heard me right! Thanks to this magical potion, I could communicate with my adorable puppy. Just imagine the joy of understanding your pet's thoughts and feelings! It's a heartwarming experience.

Thank you all for joining me on this journey through the wonders of tomorrow. Get ready to be amazed, because the future is bright and full of endless possibilities!",LOW,70,el533_9,0.20084471814809132
el551_9,"Hello! My name is Charlotte, and I am ten years old. Today, I'm going to introduce a plant that I grow.
The name of the plant I grow is called a Fork. It's named Fork because its shape resembles a fork. And its name Fork is what I created for it.
So, the shape of the Fork is very cute. 
The Fork is a species of conophyte called Cryptopodium. I bought it from a plant store on January 21, 2024.
The Fork needs to be watered once every two months. It requires a lot of sunlight and good airflow. The temperature should not drop below zero. In the fall, the plant sheds its skin, and during this time, it's important not to water it. When it sheds, the plant splits and tears apart.
I’ll care my plant, Fork really hard and make it live long.
So far, this has been an introduction about my plant, Fork. Thank you for listening, and goodbye!

Title: The Egyptian Pyramids

From now on, I will introduce the Egyptian Pyramids. Egypt is one of the world’s oldest civilizations, and its history is fascinating. It’s said to be five times larger than our country. When you think of Egypt, what comes to mind? Pyramids, right?

These pyramids were built as tombs for ancient Egyptian kings, queens, and nobles. To protect the treasures inside from robbers, they were constructed in layers, each smaller than the one below. They even added stairs as the pyramids grew taller.

The pyramids are renowned for their enormous size and perfect shape. Without modern tools, it’s a mystery how the ancient Egyptians moved and shaped those huge stones. Their architectural skills are truly remarkable.

If you visit, you’ll also see the Sphinx—a giant statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human. The Sphinx has guarded the pyramids for thousands of years. Both the pyramids and the Sphinx highlight the incredible skills of ancient Egyptians.

Environment Water Pollution

Did you ever learn about the environment? I learned environment in science class at my school. Frist of all, I will share the definition to everyone about the environment. The environment means everything around us. All our surroundings including the air, soil, water, plants, and animals make up the environment. For today, I will talk about water pollution. My name is Diana, and I am the first grade of Hanshin elementary school.
There are so many reasons to have water pollution in our world, today, I will talk about two things. Natural Causes and human causes of water pollution.
Natural causes of water pollution can occur through like volcanoes, algae blooms, animal waste, and silt from storms and floods. Especially during rainy season, water can spill over the river, and while that time, all the trash are mixing up together. And that causes water pollution.
A lot of water pollution comes from humans, too. Some of the companies have oil spills in the oceans and rivers. I think this is the biggest problem that causes water pollution. People must stop spilling oil so we can keep the water clean.

I. Love. English. I know you would all say, ""what?"" But I really do! This is Matthew, and today I would like to talk about why I learn English.

 I truly think that English is fun! Some things have same names in both languages, such as a taxi, a bus, or a computer. My favorites are words like 'apartment' or 'microphone.' The Korean language only took parts of the words and call them 'apart' and 'mic.' It's fun to learn their full names.

Also, English is very different from Korean. For example, the letter 'A' has four different sounds. 'A' as an apple, 'A' as a lake, 'A' as America, and 'A' as talk. It might be a little confusing, but I have no time to get bored!

Well the Earth has these gases around it called greenhouse gases They're cool because they keep the temperature just right for living things But if there are too many of these gases like carbon dioxide made by people the Earth gets warmer Right now it's getting hotter and that's tough for animals and plants

We can do a few things to use less energy

1. Remember to unplug stuff like TVs or computers when you're not using them And turn off the lights too

2. Try walking or taking the bus instead of always riding in a car

3. Don't open the fridge a lot that helps save energy

4. Use stairs instead of the elevator if you can

But have you ever wondered why popcorn pops? Not all corn can turn into popcorn. Popcorn is made from a special variety of corn. Here's how it works: When popcorn heats up, the water inside the kernel turns into steam. Steam is a kind of hot gas. This steam needs more and more room, so it builds up pressure. The hard shell of the popcorn kernel keeps the steam trapped inside. When the pressure gets too high - POP! - the kernel explodes and turns into fluffy popcorn. This happens so fast that it makes a popping sound. So next time you eat popcorn, remember how a tiny bit of water can turn into a yummy snack. Science can be delicious!

I believe stories shape the world we live in and connect the people we live with. I want to be a writer who writes those amazing stories. 
First, stories change the world. Every day, we dream of a better world. With the bold imagination of writers, anything can happen in the stories. We can glimpse an inconceivable world. Imagine a microchip in your brain that lets you finish homework in the blink of an eye or veggie patches on your cheek so that you can skip eating broccoli! I bet most of the ideas that appear in fiction will become reality. Isn’t it amazing?
Furthermore, stories connect people. Recently, I read a book called “Kay’s Marvellous Medicine” by Adam Kay. I couldn’t help but run to my mom and laugh with her whenever I came across hilarious sentences. I love to chat with anyone about the books I read. I think stories are the spaces where everyone can connect regardless of age, gender, or location. 
Inside me are all types of seeds. Some are big, glossy, and stripy. Some are bright, pungent, and noisy. Each seed holds its own story. Some fidgety stories wriggle inside the seed so hard that I have to let them free so that they can unfurl themselves. That’s how I cultivated a beautiful story garden.

Chase, who was Lincoln's treasury secretary, said, ""The rich never enter heaven, but the poor are already experiencing hell.""

Did you ever know how many people die because of starvation? I will tell you. Every five seconds, a child is dying due to hunger. Each day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related causes.

The first reason why many people go hungry is because of the price of grain increasing due to climate changes. Climate changes are due to pollution. The second reason is that wealth is concentrated in developed countries. People in poor countries are bound to be exposed to hunger.

What can you do to prevent starvation? Pollution should be stopped. The easy thing we can do is to eat everything without leaving any food behind. You should be thankful for the food you have right now. We should donate for undevelopped countries such as Africa. One friendly letter to Africa will give them some water and bread. Don’t just think. Move into action.

Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Tommy. Today I want to talk about someone who inspires me a lot — Elon Musk.

Have you ever dreamed of living on another planet? Or riding in a car that drives itself? Well, Elon Musk is making those dreams come true.

Elon Musk was born in South Africa and from a young age, he showed a passion for technology. He even taught himself to code when he was just 12 years old!

One of his biggest achievements was with Tesla, a company that made electric cars popular and helped reduce pollution. Tesla also pioneered self-driving technology. 

In addition to Tesla, Elon Musk also achieved great success with SpaceX, which made space travel cheaper by inventing the first reusable rocket. Thanks to SpaceX, humans might one day live on Mars!

However, what truly stands out about Musk is his determination. He failed countless times but never gave up.  He showed us that with hard work and self-belief, even the wildest dreams can come true.

Elon Musk inspires me to dream big, take risks, and never give up. I hope we all find the courage to pursue our dreams and make a difference in the world.

My dream job is to be a model. I’m really excited to share why this is my dream and what it means to me. So, let’s get started!
First, let me explain what modeling is. A model is someone who shows clothes and accessories to help designers to sell them. Models often appear in magazines, on runways, and in advertisements. It sounds like a fun job, doesn’t it?
Not only that, my mom is a model so I want to be like her every time I see her!
Also, I’ve always loved pretty things. When I was really little, I used to play dress-up and make fashion shows with my friends. It was so much fun! As I grew up, I started to think, “Hey, I want to do this for real!”
I am excited about the journey ahead, the opportunities to learn and become an amazing model!  
Thank you for listening about my dream job. I hope you enjoyed it!",LOW,20,el492_8,0.3143184382512117

There were not many characters in Inside Out 1, but more characters in appeared when Inside Out 2 was released. Next, I will tell you about my favorite character. Everyone loves Joy, but mine is different. My favorite character is Anger. Because when Joy was angry and sad, he comforted Joy. Anger is not always angry. However, I hate Anxiety. Because she almost broke the main character's brain. After watching the movie I thought about my emotions too. The most emotion that I feel is Anxiety. Because when I meet a difficult question I feel anxious. Especially mathematics. I can study mathematics with joy when I get easy mathematics questions. But when I get difficult mathematics tests, I feel anxious. And it gives me stress a lot. And I hope I could study mathematics with joy everyday.

Yi Sun-sin was a great general who lived long ago. He is best remembered for his bravery and smart strategies during the Japanese invasions of Korea, called the Imjin War. One of his most famous achievements was using special ships called ""turtle ships"". These ships had strong, armored shells that made them hard to sink.
 
General Yi Sun-sin was not only a brave fighter but also a wise leader who cared deeply about his country and his soldiers. He never gave up, even when things were tough. Because of his courage and skill, he is still remembered as a national hero in Korea today.

Hey there, future leaders! Have you ever dreamed of turning your ideas into something amazing? Maybe you’ve thought about starting a fun YouTube channel or even selling the best chocolate in town. Guess what? You can start right now! Today, I’m going to tell you how we, as kids, can turn our ideas into reality and become the next generation of awesome entrepreneurs.

 
I read about a kid called Ryan Hickman last year. When he was just 3 years old, he discovered his love for recycling on a trip to a recycling center with his dad. By age 7, he had started his own company, Ryan’s Recycling, and has since recycled over 1.6 million cans and bottles. Ryan also spoke at schools and started a nonprofit called Project3R. He believes that with support, kids can make a big difference by taking action.

 
Inspired by Ryan, I decided to start my own business. I’ve always loved drawing animals, so I thought, “What if I turned my drawings into stickers?” With my mom’s help, I made them into real stickers and started selling them on her Instagram. It was so exciting to see people actually buying my art! Even though it was a small start, I was proud to take the first step in starting my own business.

 
So, what’s stopping us? We don’t have to wait until we’re older to start making a difference. We can start right now! Whether it’s a big idea or a small one, each step brings us closer to our dreams. Let’s be brave, let’s be creative, and let’s become the kid entrepreneurs who shape the future! Thank you.",LOW,40,el610_8,0.20935211577514068

If you have immigrated or plan to go, why do you immigrate?
I would like to talk about the main cause of immigration in the 5 thousand years history of our country.
Wiman, the Chinese refugee to Gojoseon about 2400 years ago, is an early immigrant known in history books. 
Then at the end of Three Kingdoms period, the refugees of Goguryeo and Baekje collapsed by Shilla  migrated to China or Japan.  During the Goryeo Dynasty, the Khitan people who collapsed by Mongolia came to Goryeo. During the Imjin War from 1592 to 1598, many skilled-potters of Joseon were forced to move to Japan. And during the Japanese colonial period from 1910 to 1945, people moved to China or Russia to campaign for independence.
 Today, Korean immigrate for various reasons, such as business, overseas employment, studying abroad, marriage, or self-satisfaction. 
According to the history, I think that most of immigration was for the comfortable and rich life. I hope that Korea will become a safe and rich country where people from all over the world want to visit or to live. Thank you for listening.",LOW,0,el644_8,0.18403569563858643

Hello I am Sophia. 
Imagine you are just a little baby but you can not see, hear or even talk. It would be a terribly          
miserable life and that’s how Helen Keller’s life started. 

Due to a harsh fever, she lost her sight and hearing when she was only two years old. She was about to give up before she met Miss Sullivan who taught not only the language but also the manners that she should have throughout her life.

With Sullivan’s help, Helen Keller was able to learn how to speak and to read books and these made her possible to get into college. When she grew up, she helped other people to overcome disability and also did demonstration of opposing wars.  

She got over difficulties and fear in a world where she couldn’t hear or see which is the reason why I respect her deeply. Like Helen Keller, even if I get into a really hard situation, I will never give up and try my best to overcome the hardship.

First, reading books can develop our linguistic skills. Just a year ago, I didn't enjoy reading. As I had difficulties in areas such as grammar and reading, I started to read books. And as a result, I was able to make up for what I lacked and my writing ability improved.
Second, reading helps us to improve our concentration. Paying attention to the story to follow along helps our brain stay focused for longer periods of time. The more we practice reading, the better we get at focusing on other things, like schoolwork or even sports.
Lastly, reading allows us to have broader knowledge. When we read books in various fields, we can discover new facts that we didn't learn at school. The more you read, the more knowledge you gain. It makes it easier to have fun conversation with classmates.
Reading is a good daily habit! Even a few pages of reading can help us focus better, learn more, and become smarter.

Mostly all people in the world eat breakfast. Or they eat brunch. However some people state that it is okay to skip breakfast. I believe we shouldn't.
These reasons that I want to say would state why we should eat breakfast. First energy, second focusing, and lastly for hungriness.
First, people need energy in the morning when people wake up.  But, some people doze off and have a little bit of energy. When we wake up we have plenty of energy, but when we doze off we get cut off energy. So we need breakfast to fill up our energy and to wake up.
 Second we need breakfast to focus. If we don’t eat any food our heads might be filled with only food thoughts! So if we take a test, we might fail it. We might get bad grades. Small things cause big trouble in the future.
 Lastly we might suffer from hungriness. If we get hungry in school we mostly say, “Teacher, I’m hungry!”. Then the teacher would be annoyed. But, if it happens several times the teacher would be mad. Also it can disturb other classmates. It is okay to be hungry when it is close to lunch time but if  not then no.
In conclusion, we should eat breakfast. It is because of energy loss, loss of focus, and we might suffer from hungriness. These are bad because we might get scolded from our teacher or parents.

But in the tropical sea, most fish are small and they have cute appearance. Also they have vivid colors. The most popular tropical fish is called Goopy. They are very small and some people raise them at home.

Also in the cold sea, tuna and bluefin live. Probably, we eat many fish from the cold sea. In addition, craters and seaweed live in the cold sea too.

Isn't it very interesting to know about our sea! Our sea is a really amazing place!  ",LOW,0,el623_7,0.37136394163972736

Hello, my nane is Oliver. I am 10 years old and I am in the 3rd grade. Today, I am going to talk about my little jobs. To begin with, I get up at 7 o'clock in the morning. Then, I make my bed because it is my job to keep my own room clean. Next, I brush my hair and teeth before going to school. I always like to help my mom around the house so, I set up the table for breakfast. Of course, also help do the dishes after we eat breakfast together. Then, I pack my school bag by myself and go to school. After school, I make sure to do all my homework for the day. I do my best to study well because I want to make my parents proud of me. I even read a lot of books at home on my free time. Finally, after greeting my parents good night, I lay in my bed and go to sleep in my room. I am glad I can do all my little jobs by myself.",LOW,40,el454_9,0.9767515943793497
el661_8,"Hello, my name is Lee Ha Rin.
Today, I want to share how I felt like Kkamnyang after reading the book The Cat Problem Solver. 
In the story, Kkamnyang is a clever cat who
helps everyone in the village. After reading about his adventures, I wanted to be like him and make a difference. One day at school, my friend was 
very upset because she lost her favorite pencil, 
so I thought, “What would Kkamnyang do?”
Inspired by Kkamnyang, I started searching it 
everywhere. After looking around, I finally found the pencil hidden under some papers
in the corner of the classroom. When I handed 
the pencil back to my friend, her big smile made me feel so happy. I learned that we can all be 
like Kkamnyang by helping others and solving 
problems, no matter how big or small they are. 
Thank you so much for listening.

Hello everyone! My name is Liam Nemcko. I am going to tell you a surprising wish that I have. I wish I had a pet pig. Baby pigs are my favorite because they are so cute. But my friends say I’m weird because pigs are dirty.
But the good thing about having a pet baby pig is I can play with it. I want to jump around with my baby pig. We can even play soccer together. The pig can be the goalkeeper. We can watch TV and eat snacks together. I can drink juice and eat pizza and chicken with my pet pig because pigs will eat anything. We will have so much fun together.

But a big problem is that pigs like mud. My mom won’t like having a dirty house. She would get mad about my pig’s mess. 

Pigs are still my favorite, though. I’m going to imagine having a pet baby pig. I hope that I can get one for my birthday.  I promise that I would never cook my pig for dinner and I would take good care of it.

Dogs help people in many ways. Some dogs help blind people by guiding them. Others help farmers by taking care of sheep. Dogs also make people happy because they love to cuddle and give lots of love.

Hi, everyone! I'm Stella and today I want to tell you about my most favorite thing ever. Magic! 

Magic is like a supper cool trick that makes you go, ""Wow!"" It's like when you see a rabbit appear out of thin air, or when colorful ribbons fly around like they're dancing. 

You know what's the best part? Magic is all around us. It's in the stars that shine so bright at night, in the rainbows after the rain, and in the giggles of my friends when we play together. 
Magic fills our hearts with joy and happiness, like a warm hug from a unicorn!

And guess what. We can do magic, too!
With our imagination, we can become brave wizards and create our own magical adventures. 
We can ride on the back of flying dragons and explore enchanted castles!

So, let's believe in the magic all around us. 
Let's see the world with wonders and let our imagination soar high like a magical kite. 

Let's make magic every day by being kind and spreading love like a sprinkle of magic. 
Let's make this world a magical place for everyone.

Hello everyone,

My name is Nayun, Kim and today I want to talk about how the Olympic Games can bring world peace.
The Olympics are more than just a sports event. They bring together people from all over the world-different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. Even though the athletes compete against each other, they also become friends. They learn to repect each other, no matter where they come from or what language they speak.
When the Olympics happen, the whole world watches. For a few weeks, we are all connected by the same excitement and joy. We cheer for our countries, but we also cheer for the spirit of sportsmanship. This spirit is about fairness, respect, and understanding. It shows us that we can live together in peace, even if we have differences.
The Olympic Games remind us that peace is possible. If athletes from different countries can come together in friendship, then maybe, just maybe, our world leaders can too.

Hello, my name is Seung-jin. This summer, I traveled to the USA for the first time. First, I went to the airport, and I was very curious because there were so many people going to the USA. The flight to Chicago was hard because it took 14 hours. When I arrived in Chicago, I went to my grandmother’s friend's house. I spent a month there.  The next day was the best day. I got on the train and went to downtown Chicago. I bought many souvenirs there. I was so impressed by all of the huge buildings. I ate hamburgers and tried some famous ice cream, so I was full. My favorite part of the whole trip was seeing downtown. It was so different from my home in Korea, but I found a Korean mart there where I could buy Korean food. That was surprising and helped me to feel less homesick. 

My first trip to the USA was a wonderful experience and I was glad that American children were kind to me. I hope I can go again soon.
