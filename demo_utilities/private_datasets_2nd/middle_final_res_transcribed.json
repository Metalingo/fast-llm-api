How did he lose weight? Did he give up, cross by the way of injustice? No. In his isolation, he produced some of the most profound works in Korean history, shaping the very fabric of his nation's thoughts. He teaches us that even in our darkest moment, we can choose to create light. Now, let's turn to 단체 알레르기. The brilliant mind behind the divine 거미디 was also excited from his will of fullness. Did it fire, losing himself to bitterness? Rather than coming to this fire, he crafted a masterpiece that has guided contractions towards understanding and redemption.

Some can argue that 커피 can lose straight, freedom, and independence of kids, but I think how frontages are bigger than disadvantages. False, coffee is still a discipline and time management skills. Moreover, children can learn the value of spirituality and develop habits of responsibility. By having coffee, children can complete their school homework in time and attend extracal activities. according to some results, children who have organized routines have higher self-esteem and an academic achievement than who don't. second, coffee promotes safety and reducing negative events that usually happen at night times. Library can be dangerous, and children can be exposed to potential dangers when they stay at late. Those coffee can block us to walk around the streets at dangerous time and minimize the possibilities to meet helpful situations. Next, hope you can influence months between families and communications as well. The more time kids and parents spend together, the more chance to have conversations with each other. For the more, these conversations can promote trust between parents and kids, making mutual understandings. And it can also positively an emotional while being soft kids. Lately, I think despite the fact that I feel so helpful for children to learn how to follow rules and respect authorities, they can get ready to be responsible citizens who all will lose and lose by all being lose set by the balance. Understanding those authorities and boundaries contributes to shape the personality as well. In conclusion, children having coffee can be fail and beneficial since it leads kids to have good time management and to discipline. Having coffee also provides safety and reinforcing family bond, which contributes to the cause and development. So now we understand coffee doesn't limit freedom, but safe and well fell by recognizing lessons and positive effects of coffee. So, responsible students? We must always help us and recognize that it is important for our own sake and for us to get ready for successful and faceful future."

We need to give attention to trees to protect them. giving attention to trees is important for them. For example, in many countries, many rainfalls are being cut to make towns and to expand cities. We need to give attention to them and protect them. We can also solve this problem by planting trees. By planting trees, we can somewhat overcome the destruction of trees. Garbage is a very big problem on our planet. We are doing garbage everywhere. Oshan garbage is becoming a very big problem. Oshan garbage contain man's water. Contaminated water hurts marine life. We eat seafood so it means this problem is going back to us. Air pollution is a very big problem too. Air pollution causes asthma, Lung Cancer, and Emphy. There are many solutions to these problems. First, we can use public transportation. It can reduce greenhouse gas from transportation. second, you can use electric cars. Electric cars don't make greenhouse gases. You should use things that use less volatile organic compounds. Vol organic compounds causes a lot of air pollution. You should buy things that have eco labels. Things that have eco labels are eco-friendly goods. So we need to use goods that have eco-diversity. We are losing biodiversity. It is the biggest environmental problem. We are losing biodiversity by habitat destruction, introduction of invasive, and climate change. We need to protect biodiversity because of the relationship of spices. If biodiversity is destroyed, some spices will be extinct. It will put all spices in danger. So we need to protect biodiversity. There are many problems on this planet, and we need to solve these problems. I believe the environmental problem is the biggest problem on this planet, so we need to find a way out.

When I look at the current state of the environment of this planet, I feel it's too sad and afraid to bring a child into a world where they would have to live in such a difficult and harsh environment. Am I the only one who thinks this way? according to what I studied by big data map, the proportion of people who decide not to have children increased by about 10% among those who seriously perceive the climate crisis. It seems that this thought is not just mine alone. however, my thoughts have changed when I heard my mom saying, the best thing I've ever done in my life was having you and raising you. I wasn't sure how much of that was 진실, but after hearing her words, I couldn't help but imagine myself happening holding a beautiful baby. I started to wonder if it's really right to give up on such happiness and if there might be another way. If I read this maybe of consumption by 50% for the rest of my life, which I estimate to be about 80 more years, how much I could lower the air's temperature. It turns out that I could use CO2 emissions by about 46 tons, lower the temperature by about 0.00000210 degrees. I was disappointed. Then, I wonder what would happen if all the people in South Korea did the same. With a population of 51 million, the temperature could decrease by 0.1066 degrees, due to a reduction of 237 million tons of CO2 emissions. This gave me a bit of hope. And what if the entire world joined in? With a global population of 8B, we could reduce CO2 emissions by 3,750.2Bt, which could lower the temperature by about 1.672C. Now, I'm taking two actions to help reduce CO2 emissions. First, I'm replacing beef with beans, tofu and eggs in my daily diet. I'm also increasing my trust in insect-based foods. Do you like steam, syrup, and 크리스마스? If you can get past the initial prejudice, they're actually quite delicious and nutritious. second, I'm starting awareness about 글로벌월밍 through 소셧미리안 캠페인 and sharing practical ways to protect the environment so that more people can join the cause.

I don't remember much from my early years. The one thing that sticked out from my 베이킹 memories is my love for Spongebob serpents. I was so into Spongebob that I knew exactly when it was on, I made sure to be glue to the TV. Recently, I decided to binge-watch Spongebob again, but this time with my grown-up brain. And guess what? I saw the show in a whole new view. It's amazing how something that was just fun in the past, then can now be full of unexpectedly whistling. Harry was in this classic episode where squirrel was always gruggling about his job, and the 크러시 크랫 finally gets convinced by Spongebob to try a 크라비 파티. He takes one by it, and it's like it's the last food on Earth. When I was a kid, I just loved that Scott was hilarious at his appearance. But now, I realize it can be a brilliant matter for that, me trying something unfamiliar and afraid is sometimes not as bad as you have thought. At Scott's work, I didn't like him in the past, used to don't seem like a grumpy person tired of life. But now, I see him as a complex character. Sure, he's got his issues, but he's also passionate about playing the 클라이언에, even if he's not 그래대. Plus, he steps up and helps Spongebob in a crisis, who knewSquidward had a hard of goal under all the grumpyness. Then, there's also Patrick. I used to think he was just a stupid, would just stay away from Spongebob. Now, I see him in a different view. In one episode, he sacrifices his incredible intelligence. For the sake of friendship with Spongebob. I was so surprised because I didn't know that Patrick has that figure. It's a great reminder that sometimes the real value lies between the surfers. When I look back, it's clear that the characters and Spongebob weren't just strong together for laps. Everyone cares as long as they rap in humor and fun. A lot of people think the cartoons and kids shows are just for kids. But they open the pack 해도 with them that even adults can learn from. So, how about we take a trip down memory line today, let's dive back into the world of your old memory and see what new lessons we can uncover with our grown-up perspective. It'll be so much fun and it's like a nostalgia adventure with a side of grown-up insight. Thank you for listening."

        "transcribed": "The true friendship. Hi, I remember, I'd like to talk about true friendship today. What do you think about the true friendship is? Hanging out every day? giving presents all the time? I don't think so. Nowadays, most of students don't think about the true friendship. And? Want to make friends on their own, but it's not good. This friendship can be broken easily. The true friend is to talk heart to heart, motivate each other, being a source of support through hard time. The most good thing of real friendship is to believe and rely on each other without expecting compensation. So it has many good things, but I didn't know when the first semester started. I got hurt at the time, then I thought what a true friend is every day. Now, I meet a good friend so we have a heart to heart. We motivate each other. As you get along with friends, meeting many kinds of friends is as important as having true friends. Don't worry to make your own true friends at first. When you have chances to make different types of friends, you'll be able to find friends who talks heart to heart. The true friendship doesn't have to be difficult and complicated. A friend who gets along well with you can be the best friend to you. Thomas full said, Don't buy your friend's gifts. If you don't give gifts to them, they will leave you. As Jason writes saying, the friends can be bought with any gifts or snacks. And George Washington said, the similar friendship is as same as a tree which is growing up late. According to saying, the true friendship may grow late. But grow up with deep face trust. It's very hard to realize and understand, but you can do it being confident and try it. As time goes on, you'll get what it is someday."

        "transcribed": "Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future, says John F. Kennedy, the former president of the United States. Yes, as a valuable resource, children's right should be protected by the society. however, are those right actually being protected? Unfortunately, no. 800 children definitely mostly presentable and treatable causes every day. Around 300 million children are out of school and 200 million children are in forced labor. All of this shows how children's right, globally are not being protected. To solve this problem, I have two main options to suggest, which are international law and education. The good cause of children's right to violation happens mainly because of the lack of infrastructure, awareness and regulation. Insufficient infrastructure, including in adequate access to education, health care and social services, makes children vulnerable. In many communities, lack of basic infrastructure such as clean water, safe houses and school leads to the violation of their right. Moreover, a lack of awareness about children's right among government officials, communities, and parents can perpet painful practices. In many countries, legal frameworks are fully enforced, allowing the abuse of children's right and 졸업을. The international community does have duties called the convention on the right of 졸업, but does not have any legal power to protect the 졸업. Short-term solution we can make for children's right to protection is to make an international law that protects children and presents child labor. Only international treaties that were not effective in implementation. This can be implemented by motivating the citizens of developed countries. Having campaigns for developed country's citizens to be aware about the existing child abuse or child labor would make citizens to be mad and voice out. They would push the government to help the third party country's 졸은 and create a better world for the 졸은. Some may raise concerns regarding potential assistant from corporations, unable to utilize child leave, or impact on 져는 surprised from earning jobs. To mitigate these consequences, I believe that developing countries should provide an international fund that can support the children. Moreover, assistant to business is not important, as children's rights are the main priority. This is a contemporary matter to stop child leave and start educating children. Rather than the temporary impact that 졸업 cannot earn money or the business might not function properly, I believe that the fact that 졸업 can get better education, better jobs and better payment in the long run is important. In the long term, education of children should happen. Without education, children cannot have the ability to work in a good job place and explore their full potential, thus hind their ability to contribute to society. Education serves is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty, as it expends children's opportunities, financing employability, and competition and access to it's resources. I believe that children's right should be protected by the help of international communities and other developed countries for the future of our society. By prioritizing children's right to protection, we not only invest on the foundation of a just society but also contribute to sustainable role for future generations. If you think that children are really important and should be protected, you need to act out by making your country's government participate to protect children."

        "transcribed": "Good morning, this is 태원윤. As of the term 치킨 버브, I bet many of you haven't. The term is different from the concept of an economy 버브, so before we dive into the 치킨 버브, let's first understand what a 버브 economy is. An economy 버브 or 에센 버브 of course when 에센 prices are driven to levels far beyond their intrinsic value. often due to unrealistic or speculative believes about the future. One of the oldest examples of this 피너미는 is the tulip mania in the Netherlands during the 17th-century. At that time tulips were considered extremely valuable, and as people rush to invest in them, the prices skyrocket at 50 times their original value in just one month. However, when people realized these prices are unsustainable, the market collapsed and the Dutch economy so far lately. This was the first recorded economy bubble in history. Now, let's talk about the chicken bubble, which has been during comparisons to Japan's little estate bubble. The chicken bubble reports to a rapid rise in the number of chicken restaurants in Korea. Which some analysts believe could pose a draw it to the country's economy. The term was first coined by the Wall Street Journal on September 16, 2013. The article highlighted that many Korean's were opening chicken restaurants using their homes as 콜라트로. This has contributed to Korea's rising household debt, which has reached levels comparable to those seen in the U.S. before the housing market collapsed. The search in chicken restaurants is not just about the love for cheap fried chicken. It's a symptom of a deeper issue. Many of these restaurants are often by the towers, who, lacking their options, instead of saving it to these shows. Unfortunately, many of these businesses fell quickly, wasting the health of the prices. By the end of 2020, the radio of how so that this post of income in Korea had soared to 136%! The chicken bubble is a strong warning of Korea's economic structure, where a high percentage of the population is self-employed, often without sufficient preparation of a safety net. This bubble is just one aspect of a larger issue, a potential economy collapse, driven by the over-saturation of small self-run businesses. Economists are raising arms suggesting that 치킨 먹을 could help disrupting consequences for Korea's economy. To prevent this, the government must implement strong welfare properties and provide alternative tests for those at the risk of fully into this cycle."

        "transcribed": "There are 2 future in front of us. The first one, we're running out of resources, and the humanity is about to destroy. The second one, beautiful flowers are growing and we are enjoying our vacation on the beach. We should you choose, now it depends on us. This day's environmental problems are getting worse and worse. Honestly, it's been a long time since environmental issues were raised. But people don't seem to be serious about these issues. I guess, it's because we don't feel like it's going to affect us much. But while we were driving cars or building factories, labs were dying. And it affects us little by little. The coffee who made the airs badly is people. First, let's find out the reality of environmental problems. Races from residency areas and factories followed the land. Microbusts and oils followed the ocean. We should take responsibility of what we have done. There are some ways to save the horse first. Let's use more public transportation. If we use more public transportation than our own cars, we could use carbon emissions. second, we should waste sorting. Most of us might say, I do waste sorting, but we are doing it in the wrong way. About 40% of garbage cannot be recycling because it's not clean. Just cleaning our garbage before you enjoy the way could be great help. Third, what about using second-hand goods? If we use them, we can reduce our resource waste, and also we can reduce bad effects of decomposition. In Korea, there is a famous word, 아나바다, it means save, share, trade, and use. For an example, taking a 텀블러 is a good one. It is better to use a 텀블러 that can be used many times, than a 플라스티컵 that takes 100s or 100s of years to decompose. First, what about trying vegetarian food? I'm not saying you should not eat meat and just eat vegetarian food. I'm saying, how about eating vegetarian food more than usual? According to a study, if we only vegetarian diet for one day a week, we can reduce carbon emissions, equivalent to 4.5 million cars. And lastly, don't say it makes no matter if I throw the garbage on the street. Why don't you say this instead? Even if it's just me, I have to throw the trash into the trash can. If each one of us does small things together, we can become a big light. We are part of the horse, as much as the horse has given us, we must protect it. Do not think it's not your business, it's our collective business and each one of us should play their role. Making little changes can save the horse. It's the lost of running. Where are you living, what is your real home?"
