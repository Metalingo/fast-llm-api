el533_9,"Do you like stories? I love stories. I am thrilled when I can be transported to a mind-blowing place and all the more so when I am the one who creates it. I believe stories shape the world we live in and connect the people we live with. I want to be a writer who writes those amazing stories. 
First, stories change the world. Every day, we dream of a better world. With the bold imagination of writers, anything can happen in the stories. We can glimpse an inconceivable world. Imagine a microchip in your brain that lets you finish homework in the blink of an eye or veggie patches on your cheek so that you can skip eating broccoli! I bet most of the ideas that appear in fiction will become reality. Isn’t it amazing?
Furthermore, stories connect people. Recently, I read a book called “Kay’s Marvellous Medicine” by Adam Kay. I couldn’t help but run to my mom and laugh with her whenever I came across hilarious sentences. I love to chat with anyone about the books I read. I think stories are the spaces where everyone can connect regardless of age, gender, or location. 
Inside me are all types of seeds. Some are big, glossy, and stripy. Some are bright, pungent, and noisy. Each seed holds its own story. Some fidgety stories wriggle inside the seed so hard that I have to let them free so that they can unfurl themselves. That’s how I cultivated a beautiful story garden. To all my soon-to-be readers, would you visit my lovely garden?

Chase, who was Lincoln's treasury secretary, said, ""The rich never enter heaven, but the poor are already experiencing hell.""

Did you ever know how many people die because of starvation? I will tell you. Every five seconds, a child is dying due to hunger. Each day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related causes.

The first reason why many people go hungry is because of the price of grain increasing due to climate changes. Climate changes are due to pollution. The second reason is that wealth is concentrated in developed countries. People in poor countries are bound to be exposed to hunger.

What can you do to prevent starvation? Pollution should be stopped. The easy thing we can do is to eat everything without leaving any food behind. You should be thankful for the food you have right now. We should donate for undevelopped countries such as Africa. One friendly letter to Africa will give them some water and bread.

The Olympics are more than just a sports event. They bring together people from all over the world-different countries, cultures, and backgrounds.

When the Olympics happen, the whole world watches. For a few weeks, we are all connected by the same excitement and joy. We cheer for our countries, but we also cheer for the spirit of sportsmanship. This spirit is about fairness, respect, and understanding. It shows us that we can live together in peace, even if we have differences.

Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Tommy. Today I want to talk about someone who inspires me a lot — Elon Musk.

Have you ever dreamed of living on another planet? Or riding in a car that drives itself? Well, Elon Musk is making those dreams come true.

Elon Musk was born in South Africa and from a young age, he showed a passion for technology. He even taught himself to code when he was just 12 years old!

One of his biggest achievements was with Tesla, a company that made electric cars popular and helped reduce pollution. Tesla also pioneered self-driving technology. 

In addition to Tesla, Elon Musk also achieved great success with SpaceX, which made space travel cheaper by inventing the first reusable rocket. Thanks to SpaceX, humans might one day live on Mars!

However, what truly stands out about Musk is his determination. He failed countless times but never gave up.  He showed us that with hard work and self-belief, even the wildest dreams can come true.

Elon Musk inspires me to dream big, take risks, and never give up. I hope we all find the courage to pursue our dreams and make a difference in the world.

Hey there, future leaders! Have you ever dreamed of turning your ideas into something amazing? Maybe you’ve thought about starting a fun YouTube channel or even selling the best chocolate in town. Guess what? You can start right now! Today, I’m going to tell you how we, as kids, can turn our ideas into reality and become the next generation of awesome entrepreneurs.

 
I read about a kid called Ryan Hickman last year. When he was just 3 years old, he discovered his love for recycling on a trip to a recycling center with his dad. By age 7, he had started his own company, Ryan’s Recycling, and has since recycled over 1.6 million cans and bottles. Ryan also spoke at schools and started a nonprofit called Project3R. He believes that with support, kids can make a big difference by taking action.

 
Inspired by Ryan, I decided to start my own business. I’ve always loved drawing animals, so I thought, “What if I turned my drawings into stickers?” With my mom’s help, I made them into real stickers and started selling them on her Instagram. It was so exciting to see people actually buying my art! Even though it was a small start, I was proud to take the first step in starting my own business.

 
So, what’s stopping us? We don’t have to wait until we’re older to start making a difference. We can start right now! Whether it’s a big idea or a small one, each step brings us closer to our dreams.

el620_9,"Hello, My name is Rebecca. Today I'll talk about the importance of reading. As I read a lot of books for a while, I could feel the various effects of reading. I'd like to share three main things among them.
First, reading books can develop our linguistic skills. Just a year ago, I didn't enjoy reading. As I had difficulties in areas such as grammar and reading, I started to read books. And as a result, I was able to make up for what I lacked and my writing ability improved.
Second, reading helps us to improve our concentration. Paying attention to the story to follow along helps our brain stay focused for longer periods of time. The more we practice reading, the better we get at focusing on other things, like schoolwork or even sports.

Hello, my name is Seulah Kim. What’s your favorite Korean food? Galbi? Gimbap? Today, I want to tell you about my favorite food, bibimbap.
  
Bibimbap is a Korean dish with rice, vegetables,     egg, and meat. You mix everything with red pepper paste.

Why do I like bibimbap? I have three reasons. First, it has beautiful colors: orange carrots, yellow and  green zucchini, and brown meat. It’s like a rainbow in my bowl! 

Second, bibimbap has many different ingredients.  It’s the perfect food for the diverse culture of          Korea. For example, I go to school with students     from Japan, China, and the US. They make my        school life fun and exciting. The different                   ingredients do the same for bibimbap.

miserable life and that’s how Helen Keller’s life started. 

Due to a harsh fever, she lost her sight and hearing when she was only two years old. She was about to give up before she met Miss Sullivan who taught not only the language but also the manners that she should have throughout her life.

With Sullivan’s help, Helen Keller was able to learn how to speak and to read books and these made her possible to get into college. When she grew up, she helped other people to overcome disability and also did demonstration of opposing wars.  

She got over difficulties and fear in a world where she couldn’t hear or see which is the reason why I respect her deeply. Like Helen Keller, even if I get into a really hard situation, I will never give up and try my best to overcome the hardship.

These pyramids were built as tombs for ancient Egyptian kings, queens, and nobles. To protect the treasures inside from robbers, they were constructed in layers, each smaller than the one below. They even added stairs as the pyramids grew taller.

 Do you know the magazine ""Time""? Every month, they pick a new person to feature. However, in 1998, something special occurred. They didn't feature a person but picked Earth. People were concerned about what would happen if earth got sick. It was a serious problem because the maim cause was due to humans.
So, can we live in symbiosis with Earth? Yes! If we protect earth, we can live together in harmony. 
We must start to protect Earth because it's essential for our lives and future. Here are some simple ways we can protect our Earth.

 First, the most important thing  is recycling! You can do this by trashing correctly, like plastic bottles going into the recycle. I wish to encourage  you to recycle correctly too!

 Second, Plogging. This is where you pick up trash while jogging. Plogging helps you to stay healthy by exercising but you can clean up Earth at the same time. The best place would be the beach as it's often polluted very easily.

When I was 5 years old, I was very interested in puppies. Since my dad is allergic to dogs, my mom bought me a puppy doll from the Internet which I named it “Beagle”. Beagle is so cuddly and cute and likes to play imaginary role play and also likes to play hide and seek. We have been together for about 3 years, and I take him with me everywhere except school. There is one story why “Beagle” is so special to me. I once had this scary dream of T-Rex chasing after me. But then, Beagle barked really loud, which made T-Rex run away from me.

There are many convenient stores, movie theaters, libraries, nice neighbors, a river and great roads.
Of all the places here, I like to go to the library most because it is quiet. I can concentrate on reading all of the interesting books in the nice, quiet library.

Hello everyone! My name is Liam Nemcko. I am going to tell you a surprising wish that I have. I wish I had a pet pig. Baby pigs are my favorite because they are so cute. But my friends say I’m weird because pigs are dirty.
But the good thing about having a pet baby pig is I can play with it. I want to jump around with my baby pig. We can even play soccer together. The pig can be the goalkeeper. We can watch TV and eat snacks together. I can drink juice and eat pizza and chicken with my pet pig because pigs will eat anything. We will have so much fun together.

But a big problem is that pigs like mud. My mom won’t like having a dirty house. She would get mad about my pig’s mess. 

Pigs are still my favorite, though. I’m going to imagine having a pet baby pig. I hope that I can get one for my birthday.  I promise that I would never cook my pig for dinner and I would take good care of it.

We can do a few things to use less energy

1. Remember to unplug stuff like TVs or computers when you're not using them And turn off the lights too

2. Try walking or taking the bus instead of always riding in a car

Ever wonder why the weather changes? Well, the art has these gases around it called greenhouse gases. They're cool because they keep the temperature just right for living things. But if there are too many of these gases, like carbon dioxide made by people, the art gets warmer. Right now it's getting hotter and that's tough for animals and plants. We can do a few things to use less energy. Number one, remember to unplug stuff like TV's or computers when you're not using them and turn off the light too. Number 2, try walking or taking the 버스 instead of always riding in a car. Number 3, don't often freeze a lot. That helps save energy. Number 4, use their instead of the 엘리베이터 if you can. These small changes can help us a lot in the future, making ourselves better for everyone."

My name is Iris, and I am in third grade.

Today, I want to talk about our planet, Earth.

Did you know that Earth is getting very hot?

This is a big problem for all of us.

When we throw trash anywhere to make our lives easier, 

that trash comes back to us and makes our lives uncomfortable.

Right now, we have a lot of water, but by the year twenty fifty, our country could be the number one country with water problems.

This means we might not have enough water to drink or use.

To stop this from happening, we need to start working now.

We can reduce our trash, recycle more, and save water every day.

For example, using reusable bags or turning off the tap while brushing our teeth.

If we tell our family and friends about these actions, more people can join in and help.

Small actions can make a big difference!

Yi Sun-sin was a great general who lived long ago. He is best remembered for his bravery and smart strategies during the Japanese invasions of Korea, called the Imjin War. One of his most famous achievements was using special ships called ""turtle ships"". These ships had strong, armored shells that made them hard to sink.

 I truly think that English is fun! Some things have same names in both languages, such as a taxi, a bus, or a computer. My favorites are words like 'apartment' or 'microphone.' The Korean language only took parts of the words and call them 'apart' and 'mic.' It's fun to learn their full names.

Also, English is very different from Korean. For example, the letter 'A' has four different sounds. 'A' as an apple, 'A' as a lake, 'A' as America, and 'A' as talk. It might be a little confusing, but I have no time to get bored!

I went to Goesan with my mom, dad and baby brother. On the first day, my dad blew up my tube and  I played in the water. I almost fell off the tube, but I was okay. It was so funny. My mom took care of my baby brother, so I could play longer.

Later on, I was tired after swimming so I watched You-tube in the camping car and took a rest. Then, my uncle and I shot toy guns. At dinnertime, our family had a barbeque. We ate lots of meat and drank coke. Eating outside with my family was so great. At night, we shot firecrackers. It was so beautiful and colorful. I love camping and being in nature. When we came home, I was sad. It was such a great camping trip so I want to go camping again soon.

Hello, my name is Seung-jin. This summer, I traveled to the USA for the first time. First, I went to the airport, and I was very curious because there were so many people going to the USA. The flight to Chicago was hard because it took 14 hours. When I arrived in Chicago, I went to my grandmother’s friend's house. I spent a month there.  The next day was the best day. I got on the train and went to downtown Chicago. I bought many souvenirs there. I was so impressed by all of the huge buildings. I ate hamburgers and tried some famous ice cream, so I was full. My favorite part of the whole trip was seeing downtown. It was so different from my home in Korea, but I found a Korean mart there where I could buy Korean food. That was surprising and helped me to feel less homesick. 

My first trip to the USA was a wonderful experience and I was glad that American children were kind to me. I hope I can go again soon.

My name is Diana, and I am the first grade of Hanshin elementary school.
There are so many reasons to have water pollution in our world, today, I will talk about two things. Natural Causes and human causes of water pollution.
Natural causes of water pollution can occur through like volcanoes, algae blooms, animal waste, and silt from storms and floods. Especially during rainy season, water can spill over the river, and while that time, all the trash are mixing up together. And that causes water pollution.
A lot of water pollution comes from humans, too. Some of the companies have oil spills in the oceans and rivers. I think this is the biggest problem that causes water pollution. People must stop spilling oil so we can keep the water clean.

Two teams try to score goals by kicking the ball into the other team’s net.  
I love soccer because it’s fun and exciting. I play soccer with my friends during recess.
 Playing soccer with my friends is always fun and we get to work together as a team.
. I love the teamwork and strategy involved in the game. 
Playing soccer with my team has taught me how to cooperate and support others.
Soccer is not just about winning. It’s about having fun and working together.
My favorite part of soccer is making a great pass or scoring a goal. 
Soccer is an exciting sport that keeps me moving and having fun.
My favorite player is Messi, and I want to be as good as him someday. 
I also enjoy watching soccer games on TV and cheering for my favorite teams with my dad.

And playing soccer helps me stay strong and healthy.

Hello ladies and gentlemen. My name is Seunghee Yoon. I really like to exercise, so I want to tell you all about the sports activities that I like to do.  

First, I love to play dodgeball. I often play with my best friend. I am very good at dodgeball, but my friend is even better, so he usually wins.

Next, I enjoy riding my bicycle. I ride my bicycle every day. I mostly ride around my home with friends or I go to the bike path next to the river. 

Finally, my favorite sport is badminton. My dream is to be a badminton player. I really like to go to the badminton courts with my best friend. While he might beat me in dodgeball, I always win at badminton.  It feels great to see myself get better and better after lots of practice.

I like exercise because it is good for my body.
I work out a lot and it makes me healthy.

Hello, my name is Ryan. And I'm 10 years old. Among all my school subjects, I enjoy physical education the most because I find active exercise really fun. Today, I'd like to tell you about jump rope and soccer, two of my favorite sports.
First, jump rope is a simple activity which I can jump while turning a rope with my hands. I can do it anytime and anywhere. One of the best things about jump rope is that it helps me grow taller. I've been attending a jump rope academy for the past year, and thanks to that, I won first place and improved my physical strength.
Second, soccer is a sport which you score by getting the ball into the opponent's goal. To play well, you need good accuracy and speed. Recently, I played soccer with my friends, scored a goal, and we won the game! I felt really happy.

At that time, I had a talent show at winter school. My friends gathered at
my house to make buldaksam. We got cheese buldak, cream buldak, and original buldak ingredients. My friend brought rice paper from home.
We put our jackets on the sofa, washed our hands, and got to work.
First, we boiled ramen. Next, we put rice paper in hot water and put
cooked chicken on top. We wrapped it with rice paper and sprinkled sesame seeds on top of it.
One of my friends filmed a video to give to the teacher. After we finished,
I ate it together with my friends. It was so tasty.

Mostly all people in the world eat breakfast. Or they eat brunch. However some people state that it is okay to skip breakfast. I believe we shouldn't.
These reasons that I want to say would state why we should eat breakfast. First energy, second focusing, and lastly for hungriness.
First, people need energy in the morning when people wake up.  But, some people doze off and have a little bit of energy. When we wake up we have plenty of energy, but when we doze off we get cut off energy. So we need breakfast to fill up our energy and to wake up.

But, if it happens several times the teacher would be mad. Also it can disturb other classmates. It is okay to be hungry when it is close to lunch time but if  not then no.

Today I want to tell you about two things I did during my summer vacation.
First, I went to the water park. I want to the water park with my family.
When we arrived at the water park, we ate breakfast and went inside.
I did some stretching before I went into the water and played with balls. I had ice cream and
hot dogs too. It was really fun.
 
Second, I want to Gwangmyeong Cave. The cave was very cold and dark. But it was very
Interesting because I saw may bats and fish. Also I watched movies and took many pictures.
There was also a video about volcanoes, but it was too scary for me.
I almost ran away.

I like to watch TV. My favorite show is ‘We Bare Bears’. It is so funny. I also listen to music when I have free time. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music.
Of course, I love food. My favorite foods are pizza and spaghetti. My dream is to be a cook, so I want to learn how to make pizza and spaghetti. I usually eat cereal for breakfast. It is easy to make.

Most of all, I love my family. They are so nice and we do so much together. They help me with my homework everyday and listen to me when I want to talk.

Thank you for listening. Bye!
