Today, I want to talk about someone who inspires me a lot, Elon Musk. Have you ever dreamt of living on another planet riding in a car that drives itself? Well, Elon Musk is making those dreams come true. Elon Musk was born in South Africa and from a young age, he showed a passion for technology. He even taught himself to cook when he was just 12 years old. One of his biggest achievements was with 테슬라, a company that made electric cars popular and helped to use pollution. 테슬라 also found new sales driving technology. In addition to 테슬라, Elon must also achieve great success with SpaceX, which made space travel cheaper by inventing the first three useable rockets. Thanks to spacex, humans might one day live on Mars. however, what truly stands out about Musk is its determination. It failed 10,000 times but never gave up. It showed its hard work and still believes, even the widest dreams can come true. Elon Musk inspired me to dream it, take rest and never give up. I hope we all find the courage to pursue our dreams. I make a difference in the world. Thank you."

Today, I'll talk about the importance of reading. As I read a lot of books for a while, I could feel the various effects of reading. I'd like to share 3 main things among them. First, reading books can develop our linguistic skills. Just a year ago, I didn't enjoy reading. As I had difficulty in areas such as grammar and reading, I started to read books. And as a result, I was able to make up for what I lack and my writing ability improved. second, reading helps us to improve our concentration. paying attention to the story to follow along helps our brain stay focused for longer periods of time. The more we practice reading, the better we get at focusing on other things like schoolwork or even sports. Lastly, reading allows us to have better knowledge. When we read books in various field, we can discover new fact that we didn't learn at school. The more you read, the more knowledge you get. It makes it easier to have fun conversations with classmates. Reading is a good daily habit. Even a few pages of reading can help us focus better, learn more, and become smarter. Thank you!"

Every day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hungry and related causes. The first reason why many people are hungry is because of the price of bread increasing due to climate changes. Climate Changes are due to pollution. The second reason is that while we're concentrated in developed countries, people in pool countries are about to be exposed to hungry. What can you do to prevent starvation? Pollution should be stopped. The easy thing we can do is to eat everything without leaving any food behind. You should be thankful for the food you have right now. We should donate for undevelop countries such as Africa. One friendly letter to Africa will give them some water and bread. Don't just think, move into action.

Popcorn is made from a special variety of corn. Here how it works. When 팝콘이 져, the water inside the 건너 turns into steam. Steam is a kind of pocket. This steam needs more and more room, so it feels the fresher. The horses of the 팝콘 건너 keep the steam trap inside. When the pressure gets too high, the 건너 it flows and turns into lucky 팝콘. This happens so fast that it makes a 팝잉 sound. So next time you eat popcorn, remember how a tiny bit of water can turn into yummy food. That sounds delicious. Thanks for listening to my speech.

They didn't feature a person but picked Earth. People were concerned about what would happen if Earth got sick. It was a serious problem, because the main cause was due to humans. So, can we live with some biases with Earth? Yes. If we protect Earth, we can live together in harmony. We must start to protect Earth, because it's essential for our lives and future. Here are some simple ways we can protect our earth. First, the most important thing is recycling. You can do this by trashing correctly, like plastic bottles going into the recycling. I wish to invite you to recycle correctly too. second, blogging. This is where you pick up trash while jogging.

Every day we dream of a better world. With the bold imagination of writers, anything can happen in the stories. We can glimpse an inconceivable world. Imagine a microchip in your brain that lets you finish homework in the blink of an eye, or veggie patches on your cheek so that you can skip eating broccoli. I bet most of the ideas that I hear in fiction will become reality. Isn't it amazing? Furthermore, stories connected people. Recently, I read a book called Kate's Marvelous medicine by AtomK. I couldn't help but run to my mom and laugh with her whenever I came across hilarious sentences. I'd love to chat with anyone about the books I read. I think stories are the spaces where everyone can connected, regardless age, gender, or location. Inside me are all types of seeds. Some are big, glassy and strippy. Some are bright, pungent and noisy. each seed holds its own story. Some fidgety stories wruggle inside the seats so hard that I have to let them free so that they can unfurl themselves.

Fall this time, the leaves and cheese turn beautiful colors. Forest becomes the good shades of red, orange, brown and yellow. It is like nature is painting a beautiful picture. In the fall, I love to collect colorful leaves and pass them into a book. Another thing I love about fall is filling the crisp cool air when I am outdoorsy. It is perfect for wearing coldy sweaters. Being outdoorsy in the fall is the best. I love going for walks and hearing the crunch, crunch, crunch of a long leaves under my feet. It is so peaceful that I can sometimes 열, but singing or jimang, cheering in the teeth. fall is a wonderful season and my favorite time to be outside with my family. Thank you for listening."

They bring together people from all over the world, different countries, cultures and background. Even though the athletes compete again against each other. They also become friends. They want to respect each other, no matter what language they speak. When the Olympics happens, the homework washes. For a few weeks, we are all connected by the same excitement and joy. We cheer for our country, but we also cheer for the speech of sportsmanship. This speech is about fairness, respect, An understanding. It shows us that we can live together in peace even if we have differences. The Olympic games remind us that peace is possible. If athletes from different countries can come together in friendship, then maybe, just maybe, our letters can too. Thank you."

Today, I want to talk about our Planet Earth. Did you know that Earth is getting very hot? This is a big problem for all of us. When it draw trash anywhere to make our lives easier, the trash comes back to us and makes our lives uncomfortable. Right now we have a lot of water, but by the year 2050, our country could be the number 1 country with water problems. This means we might not have enough water to drink or use. To stop this from happening, we need to start working now. We can read our trash, recycle more and saving water every day for example using new German bags or turning off the tap while brushing our teeth. If we tell our family and friends about this action more people can join in and help. Small actions can make a big difference. Let's work together to protect our art and our country. Thank you for listening."
