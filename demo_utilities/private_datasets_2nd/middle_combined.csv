m600_15," The Chicken Bubble

Good morning.
This is Taewon Yun.
Have you heard of the term ""chicken bubble""?
I bet many of you haven't. The term is derived from the concept of an economic bubble, so before we dive into the chicken bubble, let's first understand what a bubble economy is.  An economic bubble, or asset bubble, occurs when asset prices are driven to levels far beyond their intrinsic value, often due to unrealistic or speculative beliefs about the future. One of the earliest examples of this phenomenon is the Tulip Mania in the Netherlands during the 17th century. At that time, tulips were considered extremely valuable, and as people rushed to invest in them, the prices skyrocketed-up to 50 times their original value in just one month. However, when people realized these prices were unsustainable, the market collapsed, and the Dutch economy suffered greatly. This was the first recorded economic bubble in history. Now, let's talk about the chicken bubble, which has been drawing comparisons to Japan's real estate bubble. The chicken bubble refers to the rapid increase in the number of chicken restaurants in Korea, which some analysts believe could pose a threat to the country's economy. The term was first coined by the Wall Street Journal on September 16, 2013. The article highlighted that many Koreans were opening chicken restaurants using their homes as collateral. This has contributed to Korea's rising household debt, which has reached levels comparable to those seen in the U.S. before the housing market collapse. The surge in chicken restaurants is not just about a love for fried chicken. It's a symptom of a deeper issue. Many of these restaurants are opened by retirees who, lacking better options, invest their savings into these ventures. 
Unfortunately, many of these businesses fail quickly, worsening the household debt crisis. By the end of 2020, the ratio of household debt to disposable income in Korea had soared to 136 percent. The chicken bubble is a stark warning of Korea's economic structure, where a high percentage of the population is self-employed, often without sufficient preparation or a safety net. This bubble is just one aspect of the larger issue-a potential economic collapse driven by the oversaturation of small, self-run businesses. Economists are raising alarms, suggesting that the chicken bubble could have devastating consequences for Korea's economy. To prevent this, the government must implement strong welfare policies and provide alternative paths for those at risk of falling into this cycle.

m632_14,"“Children are the world’s most valuable resource and its best hope for the future” says John F. Kennedy, the former president of the United States. Yes, as a valuable resource, children’s rights should be protected by society. However, are those rights actually being protected? Unfortunately, no. 800 children die from mostly preventable and treatable causes everyday. Around 300 million children are out of school and 200 million children are in forced labor. All of these shows how children’s rights, globally, are not being protected. To solve this problem, I have 2 main solutions to suggest, which is international law and education. 

The root cause of children rights’ violation happens mainly because of the lack of infrastructure, awareness and regulation. Insufficient infrastructure, including inadequate access to education, healthcare and social services makes children vulnerable. In many communities, lack of basic infrastructures such as clean water, safe houses, and schools leads to the violation of their rights. Moreover, a lack of awareness about children’s rights among government officials, communities and parents can perpetuate harmful practices. In many countries, legal frameworks are poorly enforced, allowing the abuse of children’s rights and child labour. The international committee does have treaties called Convention on the Rights of the Child while it does not have any legal power to protect the children. 

Short term solution we can make for childrens’ rights protection is to make an international law that protects children and prevents child labour. Unlike international treaties that were not effective in implementation, this can be implemented by motivating the citizens of the developed countries. Having campaigns for developed countries’ citizens, to be aware about the existing child abuse or child labour, would make citizens to be mad and voice out. They would push their government to help the 3rd party country’s children and create a better world for the children. Some may raise concerns regarding potential resistance from corporations unable to utilize child labor or impact on children deprived of earning jobs. To mitigate these consequences, I believe that developed countries should provide an international fund that can support the children. Moreover, resistance to business is not important as children’s rights are the main priority. This is a temporary method to stop child labor and start educating children. Rather than the temporary impact that children cannot earn money or the business might not function properly, I believe that the fact that children can get better education, better jobs, and better payment in the long run is important. 

In the long term, education of children should happen. Without education, children cannot have the ability to work in a good job place and explore their full potential, thus hindering their ability to contribute to society. Education serves as a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty as it expands children’s opportunities by enhancing employability, income potential and access to resources.

I believe that children’s rights should be protected by the help of international committees and other developed countries for the future of our society. By prioritizing children’s rights protection, we not only invest in the foundation of a just society but also contribute to a sustainable world for future generations. If you think that children are important and should be protected, you need to act out by making your country’s government participate to protect the children.

m468_13,"Hello, my name is Lee Dong Wook. And l'm going to start my speech.

People often say that kids have great memories, but here's a opposite example I don't remember much from my early years.

But one thing that sticks out from my vague memories is my love for SpongeBob SquarePants.

I was so into SpongeBob that I knew    exactly when it was on and made sure to be glued to the TV.

Recently, I decided to binge-watch SpngeBob again, but this time with my grown-up brain. And guess what?

I saw the show in a whole new view. 
It's amazing how something that was just funny in the past then can now be full of unexpected wisdom.


Have you ever seen this classic  episode where Squidward who's always grumbling about his job at the Krustry Krab finally gets convinced by Spongebob   to try a Krabby Patty?

He takes one bite and eats like it's the last food on Earth!

When I was a kid, I just laughed at Squidward's hilarious eating appearance.

But now? I realize it can be a brilliant metaphor that means
trying something unfamiliar
and afraid is sometimes not as bad as you have thought.

 And Squidward? 
I didn't like him in the past. He used to just seem like a grumpy person tired of life.

But now I see him as a complex character.

Sure, he's got his issues, but he's also passionate about playing the clarinet, even if he's not good at it.

Plus, he steps up and helps SpngeBob in a crisis. 

Who knew Squidward had a heart of
gold under all that grumpiness?

Then there's also Patrick.
I used to think he was just a stupid who should stay away from SpngeBob.

But now, I see him in a different view.

In one episode, he sacrifices his incredible intelligence for the sake of friendship with SpongeBob.

I was so surprised, because I didn't know that Patrick has that figure.
It's a great reminder that sometimes the real value lies beneath the surface.

When I look back, it's clear that the characters in SpongeBob weren't just thrown together for laughs.

Each one carries its own lesson, wrapped in humor and fun.

A lot of people think that cartoons and kids' shows are just for kids, but they often pack hidden wisdom that even adults can learn from.

So how about we take a trip down memory lane today?

Let's dive back into the world of your old memory and see what new lessons we can uncover with our grown-up perspectives.

It will be so much fun.

 According to a study by Bigdata Map, the proportion of people who decided not to have children increased by about 10 percent among those who seriously perceive the climate crisis. It seems that this thought is not just mine alone.

 However, my thoughts have changed when I heard my mom saying, “The best thing I’ve ever done in my life was having you and raising you.” I wasn’t sure how much of that was sincere, but after hearing her words, I couldn’t help but imagine myself happily holding a beautiful baby. I started to wonder if it’s really right to give up on such happiness and if there might be another way.
 If I reduce my beef consumption by 50 percent for the rest of my life, which I estimate to be about 80 more years, how much could I lower the Earth’s temperature? It turns out that I could reduce CO2 emissions by about 46 tons, lowering the temperature by approximately 0.000000021°C. I was disappointed. Then, I wondered what would happen if all the people in South Korea did the same. With a population of 51 million, the temperature could decrease by 0.1066°C due to a reduction of 237 million tons of CO2 emissions. This gave me a bit of hope. And what if the entire world joined in? With the global population of 8 billion, we could reduce CO2 emissions by 3,715.2 billion tons, which could lower the temperature by about 1.672°C!

 Now, I am taking two actions to help reduce CO2 emissions.
 First, I’m replacing beef with beans, tofu, and eggs in my daily diet. I’m also increasing my interest in insect-based foods. Do you like steamed silkworm chrysalis? If you can get past the initial prejudice, they’re actually quite delicious and nutritious.
 Second, I’m spreading awareness about global warming  through social media and campaigns, and sharing practical ways to protect the environment so that more people can join the cause.

My name is Cha Yu Ju.
The title of my speech ""Stevie Wonder, who changed my life""
Who do you admire most in your life?
Every time I think of Stevie Wonder, I gain courage and strength in life.
Stevie Wonder is my role model who gave me direction in life.
I’d like to talk about how he inspired me and what he means to me.
Last year, I sang the song “I just called to say I love you” at the school singing contest.
I chose this song because I had heard it a lot somewhere, had easy lyrics, and had a good rhythm.
But it wasn't as easy a song as I thought.
It was difficult to imitate Stevie Wonder’s voice and soul.
While practicing singing, I suddenly became curious about what kind of person he was. 
So, I looked in to it.
He became blind at birth due to a medical accident.
However, he did not give in to the great difficulty of not being able to see.
He discovered his talent and became a singer, creating numerous famous songs. 
Stevie Wonder wouldn’t be where he is today if he had resented and resigned himself to his disability.
As I recognized him, I felt embarrassed.
I have always been satisfied with reality, blaming my talent and surroundings without putting in much effort.
Watching him overcome his own obstacles and make a positive impact on the world through his music, I decided that I needed to change my thinking.
Let’s overcome the limits I created.
Let’s not compromise with reality and be satisfied.
Let’s continue to work hard and awaken our potential.
Stevie Wonder had a positive influence on me.
I also want to live a life of challenge and leap forward to become someone who can bring positive change to others.

  These days, environmental problems are getting worse and worse. Honestly, It’s been long time since environmental issues were raised. But people don’t seem to be serious about these issues. I guess it’s because we don’t feel like it’s going to affect us much. But while we were driving cars or building factories, lives were dying. And it affects us little by little. The culprit who made the Earth deadly is people.
  Let’s find out the reality of environmental problems. Wastes from residential areas and factories pollute the land. Micro plastics and oils pollute the ocean. And chemical gases such as carbon dioxide pollute the atmosphere. As forests are destroyed, animals lose their habitat.
  So we should take responsibility of what we have done. There are some ways to save the Earth. First, Let’s use more public transportation. If we use more public transportation than our own cars, we could reduce Carbon emissions. Second, we should do waste sorting.

Just cleaning our garbage before you throw it away could be great help. Third, what about using second hands goods. If we use them, we can reduce our resource waste.

I’m not saying you should not eat meat and just eat vegetarian food. I’m saying how about eating vegetarian foods more than usual. According to a study, if we all eat vegetarian diet for one day a week, we can reduce carbon emissions equal to 4.5 million cars. Lastly, don’t say “ It makes no matter if I throw the garbage on the street.” Why don’t you say this instead “Even if it’s just me, I have to throw the trash into the trash can.” If each one of us does small things together, we can become a big light.
  We are part of the Earth. As much as the Earth has given us, we must protect it. Do not think it’s not your business. It’s our collective business and each one of us should play their role.

Having curfew can be fair and beneficial because it teaches kid responsibilities and provides safety. Some can argue that curfew can restrict freedom and independence of the kids, but I think advantages are bigger than disadvantages. 
First, curfew instills discipline and time management skills. Moreover, children can learn the value of punctuality and develop habits of responsibility. By having curfew, children can complete their school homework in time and attend extracurricular activities. According to some research, children who have organized routines have higher self-esteem and academic achievement than who don’t.
Second, curfew promotes safety and reduce negative events that usually happen at night times. Neighborhoods can be dangerous, and children can be exposed to potential dangers when they stay out late. Thus, curfew can block us to wander around the streets at dangerous time and minimize the possibilities to meet harmful situations. 
Next, curfew can enforce bonds between families and communications as well. The more time kids and parents spend together, the more chance to have conversations with each other. Furthermore, these conversations can promote trust between parents and kids, making mutual understandings. And it can also positively impact in emotional well-beings of the kids. 
Lastly, I think respecting curfews are helpful for children to learn how to follow rules and respect authorities. They can get ready to be responsible citizens who obey rules and laws by obeying rules set by their parents. Understanding these authorities and boundaries contributes to shaping their personality as well. 
In conclusion, children having curfew can be fair and beneficial since it leads kids to have good time management, and to discipline. Having curfew also provides safety and reinforces family bond, which contributes to their growth and development. So now we understand curfews don’t limit freedom, but safeguard welfare by recognizing reasons and positive affects of curfews. As a responsible student, we must embrace curfews and recognize that it is important for our own sake and for us to get ready for successful and faithful future.

The true friend is to talk heart to heart,motivate each other,being a source of support through hard time.

Hi, I'm MIn. I'd like to talk about my cats today. I have three cats, Ddol, Kong, and Egy
First cat is Ddol. He is British longhair. He is big so, he is stronger than others. But his  voice is so low. He doesn't like a cat's fishing rod as he knows that it isn't true. But he likes to play with flashlight. He is too lazy and indifferent. So, when I call him, he doesn't answer me. But he turns on his charm when he wants some snacks. He is so adorable.
Second cat is Kong. She is Turkish Angora. She has white hair, pink ears, and green eyes. She is small for her age and weak, but she is very light-footed. She likes to sleep on my chair and play with me. She likes me the most. When I call her, she comes me fast. She likes to run on the cat wheel. She is a brave cat. When the visitors were at my house, she didn't hide. She is so pretty. I love her a lot. 
Last cat is Egy. He is Korean Shorthair.  He has brown, white hair and green eyes. He is smaller than Ddol, but he is bigger than Kong. He likes to eat cat foods and snacks. So, he is chubby. He likes all my family. He loves my mom the most. He likes to play around with his toys except a flashlight. He is so kind that he tries to be friendly to other cats. But Kong doesn't like him because he thinks that he is a leader. He doesn't like my dad much. Because when he sleeps on my dad's bed, he messes up his bed. So, my dad scolds him.

We need to give attention to trees to protect them. Giving attention to trees is important for them. For example, in many countries many rainforests are being cut to make towns and to expand cities.
